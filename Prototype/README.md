#  Notes on files/folder

- Currently our main working folder is 'Prototype'.
- Our program files can only locate those in the 'Prototype' folder.
- Files in the 'PoseEstimation_Support' folder are taken from the 'TF MoveNet sample' and cannot be referenced by those in the 'Prototype' folder, as of yet.
- Therefore, need to copy files to 'Prototype'. Where file duplicates can be seen in both folders.
